# project302

Source code and build is within the 'MY MICROLAB FINAL' .zip file.
Code samples for project 302 (my direct contributions) inside 'contributions' folder.

This project was created as part of an assessment piece during my study at Deakin University. It is a culmination of everything that I have learned and presents it in the most professional manner possible as the requirements and criteria were to simulate an industry setting, working with clients and other stakeholders as well as team members in order to develop a solution to a problem.
